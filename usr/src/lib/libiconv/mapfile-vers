# Mnemonic conditional input identifiers:
#
# - amd64, i386, sparc32, sparcv9: Correspond to ISA subdirectories used to
#	hold per-platform code. Note however that we use 'sparc32' instead of
#	'sparc'. Since '_sparc' is predefined to apply to, all sparc platforms,
#	naming the 32-bit version 'sparc' would be too likely to cause errors.
#
# -	lf64: Defined on platforms that offer the 32-bit largefile APIs
